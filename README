Rake Tasks
==========

Note that the Rakefile does not load the `config/environments.rb` file, so if you have
environment-specific tasks (such as tests), you will need to call rake with the environment:

    DAEMON_ENV=staging bundle exec rake -T

Logging
=======

One of the biggest issues with writing daemons are getting insight into what your
daemons are doing. Logging with daemon-kit is simplified as DaemonKit creates log
files per environment in log.

On all environments except production the log level is set to DEBUG, but you can
toggle the log level by sending the running daemon SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals.
SIGUSR1 will toggle between DEBUG and INFO levels, SIGUSR2 will blatantly set the
level to DEBUG.
